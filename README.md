# Zoom Clone using nodejs 
The zoom clone is build using nodejs socket.io and peerjs.

## Introduction
Nodejs is a backend javascript runtime environment that executes javascript code outside web browser.
It is very easy to create API's with the help of nodejs. I have tried to mimic some features of zoom in this project to explore nodejs.

## Technologies you need
Javascript and HTML CSS thats it!

## Project status
This clone has features of video/audio conferencing and messaging for now.
please raise issue if you find any bug.
